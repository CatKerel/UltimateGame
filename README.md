This simplies engine based on DirectX 11.

Basic 3d engine provides class, mesh (from obj) and lightning systems.
Class system has actor, pawn and controller class. Light classes contain directional and ambient lightning.
Also you can load any static meshes in .obj format (e.g. blender) with normal map!
Translation (move and rotate) and sound systems aren't ready yet.
Light and camera classes in progress (those systems exists as a part of other classes for now).

Vectors (3d and 2d) are based on Legocol's LinAl.
